# Day 19 Task: Docker for DevOps Engineers

**Till now you have learned how to create docker-compose.yml file and pushed it to the Repository. Let's move forward and dig more on other Docker-compose.yml concepts.**
**Aaj thodi padhai krte hai on Docker Volume & Docker Network** ðŸ˜ƒ

# Docker-Volume
Docker allows you to create something called volumes. Volumes are like separate storage areas that can be accessed by containers. They allow you to store data, like a database, outside the container, so it doesn't get deleted when the container is deleted.
You can also mount from the same volume and create more containers having same data.
[reference](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/)

# Docker Network
Docker allows you to create virtual spaces called networks, where you can connect multiple containers (small packages that hold all the necessary files for a specific application to run) together. This way, the containers can communicate with each other and with the host machine (the computer on which the Docker is installed).
When we run a container, it has its own storage space that is only accessible by that specific container. If we want to share that storage space with other containers, we can't do that. [reference](https://docs.docker.com/network/)


## Task-1
- Create a multi-container docker-compose file which will bring *UP* and bring *DOWN* containers in a single shot ( Example - Create application and database container )

*hints:*
- Use the `docker-compose up` command with the `-d` flag to start a multi-container application in detached mode.
- Use the `docker-compose scale` command to increase or decrease the number of replicas for a specific service. You can also add [`replicas`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63408708/how-to-scale-from-within-docker-compose-file) in deployment file for *auto-scaling*.
- Use the `docker-compose ps` command to view the status of all containers, and `docker-compose logs` to view the logs of a specific service.
- Use the `docker-compose down` command to stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes associated with the application

## Task-2
- Learn how to use Docker Volumes and Named Volumes to share files and directories between multiple containers.

<pre>
keeping data on docker volume concept
docker volume create data-volume
docker run -v data-volume:/var/lib/mysql mysql

[root@node5 yum.repos.d]# docker volume ls
DRIVER    VOLUME NAME
local     data_volume

  
if volume will not created it will create automatticly.
</pre>

- Create two or more containers that read and write data to the same volume using the `docker run --mount` command.

<pre>
keeping data on parent machine /data-volume
docker run -v /data-volumne:/var/lib/mysql mysql
docker run --mount type=bind, source=/data-volume, target=/var/lib/mysql mysql
</pre>

- Verify that the data is the same in all containers by using the docker exec command to run commands inside each container.

<pre>docker attach mysqlconname</pre>

- Use the docker volume ls command to list all volumes and docker volume rm command to remove the volume when you're done.
<pre>
[admin@node5 ~]$ sudo docker volume rm data_volume
data_volume
[admin@node5 ~]$ sudo docker volume ls
DRIVER    VOLUME NAME
</pre>


## You can use this task as *Project* to add in your resume.

You can Post on LinkedIn and let us know what you have learned from this task by #90DaysOfDevOps Challange. Happy Learning :)
