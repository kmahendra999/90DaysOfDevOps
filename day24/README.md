# Day 24 Task: Complete Jenkins CI/CD Project

Let's make a beautiful CI/CD Pipeline for your Node JS Application üòç

## Did you finish Day 23?

- Day 23 was all about Jenkins CI/CD, make sure you have done it and understood the concepts. As today You will be doing one Project End to End and adding it to your resume :)
- As you have worked with Docker and Docker compose, it will be good to use it in a live project.

# Task-01

- Fork [this](https://github.com/LondheShubham153/node-todo-cicd.git) repository:
- Create a connection to your Jenkins job and your GitHub Repository via GitHub Integration.
- Read About [GitHub WebHooks](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-too-add-github-webhook-to-a-jenkins-pipeline-62b0be84e006) and make sure you have CICD setup
- Refer [this](https://youtu.be/nplH3BzKHPk) video for the entire project

# Task-02

- In the Execute shell run the application using Docker compose
- You will have to make a Docker Compose file for this Project (Can be a good open source contribution)
- Run the project and give yourself a treat:)
