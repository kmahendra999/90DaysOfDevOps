What is DevOps?
DevOps is a methodology which Involves practices to bridge the gap of Dev and ops team by using Open source automation build tools.
These are the articles which I refered to,
formal defination   :   "DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users."
The main goal of DEVOPS is to shorten cycle time. Start with the release pipeline. How long does it take to deploy a change of one line of code or configuration.
---------------------------

Q. difference between agile methodology and devops
Ans : Agile is a philosophy about how to develop and deliver software, while DevOps describes how to continuously deploy code through the use of modern tools and automated processes.

What is Automation, Scaling, Infrastructure
Automation:

Definition: The use of technology and tools to perform tasks without manual intervention.
Purpose: Streamlines and accelerates repetitive processes, reducing errors and increasing efficiency in software development and operations.
Scaling:

Definition: Adapting systems to handle increased workloads or demand seamlessly.
Purpose: Ensures that applications and infrastructure can grow or shrink in response to varying levels of user activity, maintaining performance and responsiveness.
Infrastructure:

Definition: The underlying foundation of software systems, encompassing hardware, servers, networks, and other components.
Purpose: Manages and supports the deployment and operation of software applications, providing a reliable and scalable environment for development and execution.
---------------------------
Why DevOps is Important
DevOps is important for several reasons:

Collaboration: Fosters collaboration between development and operations teams, breaking down silos and promoting a culture of shared responsibility.

Efficiency: Automation and streamlined processes result in faster development cycles, quicker releases, and reduced time-to-market.

Reliability: Enhances system stability and reliability through automated testing, continuous integration, and continuous delivery practices.

Scalability: Facilitates seamless scaling of infrastructure and applications to meet changing demands, ensuring optimal performance under varying workloads.

Quality: Continuous testing and integration improve code quality, reducing bugs and enhancing overall software reliability.

Feedback Loop: Shortens feedback loops between development and operations, enabling quick response to issues and continuous improvement.

Risk Mitigation: Identifies and addresses issues early in the development process, reducing the likelihood of critical errors in production.

Customer Satisfaction: Faster delivery of features and improvements leads to higher customer satisfaction and a competitive edge in the market.
