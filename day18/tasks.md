# Day 18 Task: Docker for DevOps Engineers

Till now you have created Docker file and pushed it to the Repository. Let's move forward and dig more on other Docker concepts.
Aj thodi padhai krte hai on Docker Compose ðŸ˜ƒ

## Docker Compose
- Docker Compose is a tool that was developed to help define and share multi-container applications.
- With Compose, we can create a YAML file to define the services and with a single command, can spin everything up or tear it all down.
- Learn more about docker-compose [visit here](https://tecadmin.net/tutorial/docker/docker-compose/)

## What is YAML?
- YAML is a data serialization language that is often used for writing configuration files. Depending on whom you ask, YAML stands for yet another markup language or YAML ainâ€™t markup language (a recursive acronym), which emphasizes that YAML is for data, not documents. 
- YAML is a popular programming language because it is human-readable and easy to understand.
- YAML files use a .yml or .yaml extension.
- Read more about it [here](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-yaml)

## Task-1

Learn how to use the docker-compose.yml file, to set up the environment, configure the services and links between different containers, and also to use environment variables in the docker-compose.yml file. 

[Sample docker-compose.yaml file](https://github.com/LondheShubham153/90DaysOfDevOps/blob/master/2023/day18/docker-compose.yaml)

<pre>
[root@node5 ~]# mkdir test1
[root@node5 ~]# cd test1
[root@node5 test1]# vim docker-compose.yml 
[root@node5 test1]# cat docker-compose.yml 
version : "3.3"
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  db:
    image: mysql
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    environment:
      - "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=test@123"
[root@node5 test1]# docker compose up -d

## Task-2
- Pull a pre-existing Docker image from a public repository (e.g. Docker Hub) and run it on your local machine. Run the container as a non-root user (Hint- Use `usermod ` command to give user permission to docker). Make sure you reboot instance after giving permission to user.
<pre>
Make sure docker is installed and system is updated (This is already been completed as a part of previous tasks):
sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
Reboot the machine.
</pre>
- Inspect the container's running processes and exposed ports using the docker inspect command.

</pre>

## How to run Docker commands without sudo?
- Make sure docker is installed and system is updated (This is already been completed as a part of previous tasks):
- sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER 
- Reboot the machine.

You can Post on LinkedIn and let us know what you have learned from this task by #90DaysOfDevOps Challange. Happy Learning :)
